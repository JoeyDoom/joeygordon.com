        <h3>Westbury Friends School</h3>
        <p>Westbury Friends School needed a website that made it easy for parents of prospective students to learn about their programs, schedule a visit, and apply, all while keeping parents of current students informed and engaged.</p>
        <p>The result was a beautiful website utilizing on-site photography, with easy-to-access information and events, and a simple application process (including taking application fees).</p>
