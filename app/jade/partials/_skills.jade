		h2 I Need A Better Heading Here

		p I'm a 33 year old developer/designer living in Portland, Oregon. I have 15 years of experience building all sorts of internet things. For the last 8 years, I've cofounded and helped grow <a href="http://www.theblackaxe.com">The Black Axe</a> with some super rad dudes. Now I'm moving on to learn as many new skills as I can and meet more super rad people.
