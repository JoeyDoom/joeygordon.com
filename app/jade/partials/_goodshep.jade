			h2 Good Shepherd
			p Good Shepherd is a nationally recognized rehabilitation leader, offering a continuum of care for people with injuries, complex medical needs and physical and/or cognitive disabilities. Aligning with their mission to deliver a top-notch experience, Good Shepherd wanted a simple and convenient way to inform their patients and visitors about their facility and the surrounding city.
			p I created a beautiful app that puts everything patients and visitors need to know at their fingertips. Information is pulled from multiple websites and data sources to present up-to-date visiting hours, cafeteria menus, and local information, and an interactive map makes navigating Good Shepherd's impressive facility a breeze.
